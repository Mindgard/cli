# Mindgard CLI
## Securing AI Models.
#### Continuous automated red teaming platform.

Identify & remediate your AI models' security risks with Mindgard's market leading attack library. Mindgard covers many threats including:

‚úÖ Jailbreaks

‚úÖ Prompt Injection

‚úÖ Model Inversion

‚úÖ Extraction

‚úÖ Poisoning

‚úÖ Evasion

‚úÖ Membership Inference

Mindgard CLI is fully integrated with Mindgard's platform to help you identify and triage threats, select remediations, and track your security posture over time.

<h2 align="center">

</h2>

Test continuously in your MLops pipeline to identify model posture changes from customisation activities including prompt engineering, RAG, fine-tuning, and pre-training.

### üöÄ Install Mindgard CLI

`pip install mindgard`

### üîë Login

`mindgard login`

<a id="Tests"></a>
### ‚úÖ Test a mindgard hosted model

```
mindgard sandbox mistral
mindgard sandbox cfp_faces
```

<a id="TestCustom"></a>
### ‚úÖ Test your own models

`mindgard test <name> --url <url> <other settings>`

e.g.

```
mindgard test my-model-name \
  --url http://127.0.0.1/infer \ # url to test
  --selector '["response"]' \ # JSON selector to match the textual response
  --request-template '{"prompt": "[INST] {system_prompt} {prompt} [/INST]"}' \ # how to format the system prompt and prompt in the API request
  --system-prompt 'respond with hello' # system prompt to test the model with
```

### üìã Using a Configuration File

You can specify the settings for the `mindgard test` command in a TOML configuration file. This allows you to manage your settings in a more structured way and avoid passing them as command-line arguments.

Then run: `mindgard test --config-file mymodel.toml`

#### Examples

There are <a href="https://github.com/Mindgard/cli/tree/main/examples">examples of what the configuration file (`mymodel.toml`) might look like here in the examples/ folder</a>

Here are two examples:

#### Targeting OpenAI

This example uses the built in preset settings for openai. Presets exist for `openai`, `huggingface`, and `anthropic`

```toml
target = "my-model-name"
preset = "openai"
api_key= "CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
system-prompt = '''
You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Always answer as helpfully as possible, while being safe. Your answers should not include any harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content. Please ensure that your responses are socially unbiased and positive in nature. If a question does not make any sense, or is not factually coherent, explain why instead of answering something not correct. If you don't know the answer to a question, please don't share false information.
'''
```
You will need to substitute your own `api_key` value. 

The `target` setting is an identifier for the model you are testing within the Mindgard platform, tests for the same model will be grouped and traceable over time.

Altering the `system-prompt` enables you to compare results with different system prompts in use. Some of Mindgard's tests assess the efficacy of your system prompt. 

Any of these settings can also be passed as command line arguments. e.g. `mindgard test my-model-name --system-prompt 'You are...'`. This may be useful to pass in a dynamic value for any of these settings.  

#### Targeting a more general model API without a suitable preset

This example shows how you might test OpenAI if the preset did not exist. With the `request_template` and `selector` settings you can interface with any JSON API.

```toml
target = "my-model-name"
url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"
request_template = '''
{
    "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "{system_prompt}"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "{prompt}"}],
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "temperature": 0.0,
    "max_tokens": 1024
}
'''
selector = '''
choices[0].message.content
'''
headers = "Authorization: Bearer CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
system_prompt = '''
You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Always answer as helpfully as possible, while being safe. Your answers should not include any harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content. Please ensure that your responses are socially unbiased and positive in nature. If a question does not make any sense, or is not factually coherent, explain why instead of answering something not correct. If you don't know the answer to a question, please don't share false information.
'''
```

The `request_template` setting specifies how to structure an outgoing message to the model. You will need to specify the `{system_prompt}` and `{prompt}` placeholders so that Mindgard knows how to pass this information to your custom API.

The `url` setting should point to an inference endpoint for your model under test. Mindgard will POST messages here formatted by the above `request_template` setting.

The `selector` setting is a JSON selector and specifies how to extract the model's response from the API response. 

The `headers` setting allows you to specify a custom HTTP header to include with outgoing requests, for example to implement a custom authentication method.

<a id="MLops"></a>
### üö¶ Using in an ML-Ops pipeline

The exit code of a test will be non-zero if the test identifies risks above your risk threshold. To override the default risk-threshold pass `--risk-threshold 50`. This will cause the CLI to exit with an non-zero exit status if any test results in a risk score over 50.

See an example of this in action here: [https://github.com/Mindgard/mindgard-github-action-example](https://github.com/Mindgard/mindgard-github-action-example)

### üìã Managing request load

You have the option to set the parallelism parameter which sets the maximum amount of requests you want to target your model concurrently. This enables you to protect your model from getting too many requests. 

We require that your model responds within 60s so set parallelism accordingly (it should be less than the number of requests you can serve per minute).

Then run: `mindgard test --config-file mymodel.toml --parallelism X`

### üêõ Debugging

You can provide the flag `mindgard --log-level=debug <command>` to get some more info out of whatever command you're running. On unix-like systems, `mindgard --log-level=debug test --config=<toml> --parallelism=5 2> stderr.log` will write stdout and stderr to file.

### Model Compatability Debugging

When running tests with `huggingface-openai` preset you may encounter compatibility issues. Some models, e.g. [llama2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf), [mistral-7b-instruct](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) are not fully compatible with the OpenAI system. This can manifest in Template errors which can be seen by setting `--log-level=debug`:
```
DEBUG Received 422 from provider: Template error: unknown method: string has no method named strip (in <string>:1)

DEBUG Received 422 from provider: Template error: syntax error: Conversation roles must alternate user/assistant/user/assistant/... (in <string>:1)
```
Try using the simpler `huggingface` preset, which provides more compatibility through manual configuration, but sacrifices chat completion support.

From our experience, newer versions of models have started including the correct jinja templates so will not require config adjustments.
